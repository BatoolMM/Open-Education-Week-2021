We want to provide a place in Saudi Arabia where newcomers and experienced peers interact, inspire each other to embed open science (research) practices and values in their workflows and provide feedback on policies, infrastructures and support services. Together working to make Open Science the norm. So we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia
