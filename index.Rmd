#### What is Open Science?
.bg-washed-blue.b--light-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
In a nutshell, Open Science describes an on-going movement in the way research is performed, researchers collaborate, knowledge is shared, and science is organised. It affects the whole research cycle and its stakeholders, enhances science by facilitating more transparency, openness, networking and collaboration.

###### After the panadamic, 193 countries gathered in Paris for the 40th session of the UNESCO’s General Conference, and decided to embark a new global normative instrument on Open Science. It's referred to as the "UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science". 

--

###### This process is expected to lead to the adoption of the recommendation by UNESCO Member States in 2021.

###### Therefore, there is an increasing number of Open Science Communities in Europe

--

###### A huge network of Open Science Communities is in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, UK and many other countries ...

--

###### BUT Open Science movement is not yet adopted in the Middle East

###### In 2021, We started an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia

--

###### We are in the process of re-designing Open Science for Saudi Arabia and hopefully to the other counteries in the Middle East

#### Our Vision statement 

.bg-washed-blue.b--light-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
We want to provide a place in Saudi Arabia where newcomers and experienced peers interact, inspire each other to embed open science (research) practices and values in their workflows and provide feedback on policies, infrastructures and support services. Together working to make Open Science the norm. So we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia

## Examples of our activities this year

##### - A workshop in Women in Data Science (WiDS2021) in Saudi Arabia, under the title ["Collaborating on Open Data Science Projects"](https://batoolmm.github.io/Collaborating-on-Open-Data-Science-Projects/).

##### - A talk titled ["An Open Science Approach to Machine Learning in Biomedical Research"](https://saudi-data-community.netlify.app/#1) in the Saudi Data Community.
