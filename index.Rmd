#### What is Open Science?
.bg-washed-blue.b--light-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
In a nutshell, Open Science describes an on-going movement in the way research is performed, researchers collaborate, knowledge is shared, and science is organised. It affects the whole research cycle and its stakeholders, enhances science by facilitating more transparency, openness, networking and collaboration.

###### After the pandemic, 193 countries gathered in Paris for the 40th session of the UNESCO's General Conference and decided to embark on a new global normative instrument on Open Science. It's referred to as the "UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science".

--

###### This process is expected to lead to the adoption of the recommendation by UNESCO Member States in 2021.

###### Therefore, there is an increasing number of Open Science Communities in Europe

--

###### A vast network of Open Science Communities is in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, UK and many other countries ...

--

###### BUT Open Science movement is not yet adopted in the Middle East


---

class: center, middle, inverse
###### In 2021, We started an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia

--

###### We are in the process of re-designing Open Science for Saudi Arabia to potentially be adopted by the other countries in the Middle East

--

###### The Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia aims to create significant value towards Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, that focus on enhancing knowledge and improving equal access to education in the Kingdom

###### The Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia is supported by [Open Life Science Programme](https://openlifesci.org/)

###### Led by Batool Almarzouq, Anelda Van der Walt and Paula Moraga

#### Our Vision statement 

.bg-washed-blue.b--light-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
We want to create a space in Saudi Arabia where newcomers and seasoned peers can connect, inspire each other, and provide input on policies and infrastructures. Working together to make Open Science the norme. So, we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia
